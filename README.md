# Hey.
So just right up front, I'm extremely new to Rust. Like, I just started learning within a week of writing this. As a result, this code will be..."a bit ugly."
You've been warned!

# Wots all this then?
This project was born out of my frustration with the Windows command line.
* Autocomplete sucks in it.
* Every time I type `ls` and get `'ls' iS nOt ReCoGnIzEd As An InTeRnAl Or ExTeRnAl CoMmAnD...` it makes me want to die inside.
* Oh? Make an alias of `dir`? Yeah, also the `dir` command's output is ugly anyway.
* Typing `cd %HOMEPATH%` is an absolute mouthful.
* No autocompletion of subdirectories in `cd`.
* Some other things I didn't feel like listing here.

Also I want to learn Rust. I learn by doing, not by watching someone else. So I've got two problems to solve here...might as well kill two birds with one stone. Hence, this program.

# Questions that have not been frequently asked, but that people will probably ask anyway.
* Why not use Powershell?
    * EW, GROSS!
* It's better than cmd...
    * THAT'S GROSS TOO!
* What about the Ubuntu Subsystem for Windows?
    * Yeah, it's pretty cool, but often times I want to be able to access my stuff from the command line *outside* of the closed off subsystem environment.
* What about cygwin?
    * Same problem.
* Why don't you just run Linux?
    * I'd love to! Unfortunately, I have applications that only run in a Windows environment.
* Why Rust?
    * 'Cause it's fast, safe, and they've got a neat crab.
    * Also I want to learn it.
* Why did you do `<insert dumb code here>` when you could have done `<insert smarter code here>`?
    * Because I'm bad at Rust - Did you even read the top?
