# Hey.
So just right up front, I'm extremely new to Rust. Like, I just started learning within a week of writing this. As a result, this code will be..."a bit ugly."
You've been warned!

# Wots all this then?
This project was born out of my frustration with the Windows command line.
* Autocomplete sucks in it.
* Every time I type `ls` and get `'ls' is not recognized as an internal or external command...` it makes me want to die inside.
* Oh? Make an alias of `dir`? Yeah, also the `dir` command's output is ugly anyway.
* Typing `cd %HOMEPATH%` is an absolute mouthful.
* No autocompletion of subdirectories in `cd`.
* Some other things I didn't feel like listing here.

Also I want to learn Rust. I learn by doing, not by watching someone else. So I've got two problems to solve here...might as well kill two birds with one stone. Hence, this program.
